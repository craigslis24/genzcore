## About the Collection

Short-form content has overtaken people's relationships with memory, emotion, and each other. The purpose of this collection is to permanently capture nostalgia and the feelings surrounding it. Those who experienced playing, giving, or dreaming about the items in this collection are invited to sit with the past. 



The template repository features four objects from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital).
