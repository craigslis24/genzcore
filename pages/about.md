## About the Collection

Short-form content has overtaken people's relationships with memory, emotion, and each other. The purpose of this collection is to permanently capture nostalgia and the feelings surrounding it. Those who experienced playing, giving, or dreaming about the items in this collection are invited to interact with their past. The photos were taken by me in March 2024. I own the copyright.

Sophia Craig is a graduate student studying library science and English literature. While she is not reading and writing, she finds herself thinking about how she used to spend her time with her sisters and mom. That is, she often created unnecessarily elaborate storylines for her toys, as hinted at in the descriptions of each image.
