## About the Collection

Short-form content has overtaken people's relationships with memory, emotion, and each other. The purpose of this collection is to permanently capture nostalgia and the feelings surrounding it. Those who experienced playing, giving, or dreaming about the items in this collection are invited to interact with their past. The photos were taken by me in March 2024. I own the copyright.

## About the Creator

I am currently a graduate student studying library science and English literature. While I am not reading and writing, I find myself thinking about how I used to spend my time with my sisters and mom. That is, we often created unnecessarily elaborate storylines for our toys, as hinted at in the descriptions of each image.
